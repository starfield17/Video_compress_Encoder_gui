# Video Compressor GUI layer guide

`gui/` is the PySide6 UI layer. It may import `core` and the standard library, and
other `gui` modules — never `cli`, and nothing above it in the dependency graph
(`main.py` is the composition root).

## Entrypoint and composition

- `gui.gui_entry` is the only GUI entrypoint and the only module allowed to import
  `gui.gui_mainwindow`. It builds the `TranslationCatalog`, parses `--lang` against
  it, and constructs `MainWindow`.
- `MainWindow` is the composition root for the GUI: it owns source/output selection,
  presets, workers, the queue, Settings, and the Activity Log, and coordinates the
  sub-panels.
- No other `gui` sub-module may import `gui.gui_mainwindow`.

## EncodeOptionsPanel

`gui.encode_options_panel.EncodeOptionsPanel(QWidget)` owns the Basic / Video /
Audio-Subtitles tabs and all internal wiring: codec/backend
filtering from runtime capabilities, encoder-preset refresh, analysis-profile state,
and Smart/Fixed control syncing.

- `MainWindow` interacts only through the public contract:
  `read_options()`, `apply_options()`,
  `apply_analysis_profile_settings()`, `current_analysis_profile_name()`,
  `sync_dependent_controls()`,
  `set_runtime_capabilities()`, `notify_capability_detection_failed()`,
  `begin_capability_detection()`, `set_translator()`, `set_busy()`.
- Semantic signals: `codec_changed`, `compression_mode_changed`,
  `analysis_profile_changed`, `options_changed`.
- `MainWindow` must not reach into the panel's raw widgets; tests that need widget
  state access them via `window.options_panel.<widget>`.
- The panel renders the capability snapshot produced by `CapabilityWorker`.
  Encoder entries include `preset_choices`; never run FFmpeg discovery or encoder
  probing synchronously from a widget refresh path.

## Queue layering

- `gui.queue_state` — Qt-free queue record/status/metrics logic. Imports `core` only.
- `gui.queue_actions` — Qt-free quality/size decision and file-side-effect actions
  over one queue record.
- `gui.queue_model` — `QueueTableModel`, `QueueColumn` and column metadata, cell
  formatting, roles and Qt notifications. Delegates mutations to `queue_state` and
  `queue_actions`; never owns receipt, constraint or file side effects.
- `gui.queue_view` — `ResponsiveQueueTableView`, header resize modes, reflow, and the
  `create_queue_view()` factory. May use `gui.queue_model`'s column definitions.
- `gui.queue_manager` — Qt worker/thread orchestration over the model.
- `gui.queue_completion` — skipped-source publishing, reports, notifications and
  confirmed post-run actions. `QueueCompletionHandler.handle(records, translator,
  config)` receives only the completed run's records and current settings.
  MainWindow supplies log/notify/close callbacks; the handler uses its parent
  widget only for dialog ownership and never accesses MainWindow members.
- The global `encode_workers` application setting controls concurrent full-file
  encodes. Queue workers preserve each plan item's encoder binding; concurrency
  is not a preset option and does not select or rotate backends.
- View may depend on the model; model and state must not depend on the view.

## MainWindow scope

`MainWindow` remains the GUI composition root and owns source selection, queue
interaction and platform notification delivery. QueueManager decides when a run
has completed; MainWindow resolves that run's IDs and delegates completion work
to QueueCompletionHandler. UI construction remains in same-class builder methods.

Pyright covers queue state/actions/model/manager, GUI workers and completion
handling. QueueTableModel stores its application translator as `translator`,
leaving Qt's `tr()` method intact.
